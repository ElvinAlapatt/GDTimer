# GD Timer ⏱️

A simple web app to track individual speaking times during a Group Discussion (GD), while also monitoring the overall GD time. Built using Angular 20.

## 🚩 Problem

During a GD, it’s often difficult to:

- Track each participant’s individual speaking time.
- Respond immediately with a breakdown of each participant's time.
- Keep an eye on the overall time of the session.
- Share time data quickly and cleanly, especially in platforms like Google Meet chat.

## 💡 Solution

**GD Timer** was created to solve these problems in a lightweight and user-friendly way:

- ✅ Add stopwatch cards dynamically for each participant.
- ✅ Track each person's time individually.
- ✅ Pause/resume/reset timers independently.
- ✅ Automatically pause others when one starts.
- ✅ Export all timers as plain text (e.g., `Name - 02:35`), perfect for pasting into chat.
- ✅ Persist state using local storage (reload-safe).
